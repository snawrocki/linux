Samsung S5P/EXYNOS SoC Camera Subsystem (FIMC)
----------------------------------------------

The Exynos Camera subsystem uses a dedicated device node associated with
top level device driver that manages common properties of the whole subsystem,
like common camera port pins or clocks for external image sensors. This
aggregate node references related platform sub-devices - FIMC, FIMC-LITE,
MIPI-CSIS [1], and it also contains nodes describing image sensors wired to
the host SoC's video port and using I2C or SPI as the control bus.


Common 'camera' node
--------------------

Required properties:

- compatible	   : must be "samsung,fimc"
- fimc-controllers : an array of phandles to 'fimc' device nodes,
		     size of this array must be at least 1;

Optional properties:

- csis-controllers : an array of phandles to 'csis' (CSI Slave) device nodes,
		     it is required for sensors with MIPI-CSI2 bus;

- samsung,camport-a-gpios, samsung,camport-b-gpios : gpio specifier list for
			   the parallel camera ports A and B respectively;

  For 'itu-601' video bus the list length must be 13, for 'itu-656' at least
  10 and for 'video-mipi-csi2-bus' the array should contain at least one gpio
  (CLKOUT). The meaning of the gpios is as following: DATA[7:0], PCLK, VSYNC,
  HREF, CLKOUT, FIELD. It is not required to list gpios exactly in that order.
  All gpios listed here will be configured into camera port function.
  In case of ITU-R BT.656 bus the VSYNC, HREF, and FIELD pins remain unused,
  hence don't need to be specified here.


'fimc' device node
------------------

Required properties:

- compatible : should be one of:
		"samsung,s5pv210-fimc"
		"samsung,exynos4210-fimc";
		"samsung,exynos4412-fimc";
- reg	     : physical base address and size of the device memory mapped
	       registers;
- interrupts : FIMC interrupt to the CPU should be described here;
- cell-index : FIMC IP instance index, the number of available instances
	       depends on the SoC revision. For S5PV210 valid values are:
	       0...2, for Exynos4x1x: 0...3.


'fimc-lite' device node
-----------------------

Required properties:

- compatible : should be one of:
		"samsung,exynos4212-fimc";
		"samsung,exynos4412-fimc";
- reg	     : physical base address and size of the device's memory mapped
	       registers;
- interrupts : should contain FIMC-LITE interrupt;
- cell-index : FIMC-LITE IP instance index;


The 'sensor' nodes
------------------

Required properties:

 - i2c-client : a phandle to an image sensor I2C client device;

Optional properties:

- samsung,camif-mux-id : FIMC video multiplexer input index; for camera
			 port A, B, C the indexes are 0, 1, 0 respectively.
			 If this property is not specified a default 0
			 value will be used by driver.

- samsung,fimc-camclk-id : the SoC CAM_MCLK clock output index. These clocks
			   are master clocks for external image processors.
			   If this property is not specified a default 0 value
			   will be used by driver.

 "video-bus-type" and "clock-frequency" properties must be specified at the
 node referenced by 'i2c-client' phandle.

Example:

	fimc0: fimc@11800000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-fimc";
		reg = <0x11800000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 85 0>;
		cell-index = <0>;
	};

	csis0: csis@11880000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-csis";
		reg = <0x11880000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 78 0>;
		cell-index = <0>;
	};

	camera {
		compatible = "samsung,fimc";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		fimc-controllers = <&fimc0>;
		csis-controllers = <&csis0>;
	};
