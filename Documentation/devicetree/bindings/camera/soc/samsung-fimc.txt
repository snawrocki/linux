Samsung S5P/EXYNOS SoC Camera Subsystem (FIMC)
----------------------------------------------

The Exynos Camera subsystem uses a dedicated device node associated with
top level device driver that manages common properties of the whole subsystem,
like common camera port pins or clocks for external image sensors. This
aggregate node references related platform sub-devices - FIMC, FIMC-LITE,
MIPI-CSIS [1], and it also contains nodes describing image sensors wired to
the host SoC's video port and using I2C or SPI as the control bus.


Common 'camera' node
--------------------

Required properties:

- compatible	   : must be "samsung,fimc"
- fimc-controllers : an array of phandles to 'fimc' device nodes,
		     size of this array must be at least 1;

Optional properties:

- csi-rx-controllers : an array of phandles to 'csis' device nodes,
		       it is required for sensors with MIPI-CSI2 bus;

'fimc' device node
------------------

Required properties:

- compatible : should be one of:
		"samsung,s5pv210-fimc"
		"samsung,exynos4210-fimc";
		"samsung,exynos4412-fimc";
- reg	     : physical base address and size of the device memory mapped
	       registers;
- interrupts : FIMC interrupt to the CPU should be described here;
- cell-index : FIMC IP instance index, the number of available instances
	       depends on the SoC revision. For S5PV210 valid values are:
	       0...2, for Exynos4x1x: 0...3.

Example:

	fimc0: fimc@11800000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-fimc";
		reg = <0x11800000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 85 0>;
		cell-index = <0>;
	};

	csis0: csis@11880000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-csis";
		reg = <0x11880000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 78 0>;
		cell-index = <0>;
	};

	camera {
		compatible = "samsung,fimc";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		fimc-controllers = <&fimc0>;
		csi-rx-controllers = <&csis0>;
	};
